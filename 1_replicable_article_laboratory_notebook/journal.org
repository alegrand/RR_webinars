***** Emacs shortcuts
Here are a few convenient emacs shortcuts for those that have never
used emacs. In all of the emacs shortcuts, =C=Ctrl=, =M=Alt/Esc= and
=S=Shift=.  Note that you may want to use two hours to follow the emacs
tutorial (=C-h t=). In the configuration file CUA keys have been
activated and allow you to use classical copy/paste (=C-c/C-v=)
shortcuts. This can be changed from the Options menu.
  - =C-x C-c= exit
  - =C-x C-s= save buffer
  - =C-g= panic mode ;) type this whenever you want to exit an awful
    series of shortcuts
  - =C-Space= start selection marker although selection with shift and
    arrows should work as well
  - =C-l= reposition the screen
  - =C-_= (or =C-z= if CUA keys have been activated)
  - =C-s= search
  - =M-%= replace
  - =C-x C-h= get the list of emacs shortcuts
  - =C-c C-h= get the list of emacs shortcuts considering the mode you are
    currently using (e.g., C, Lisp, org, ...)
  There are a bunch of cheatsheets also available out there (e.g.,
  [[http://www.shortcutworld.com/en/linux/Emacs_23.2.1.html][this one for emacs]] and [[http://orgmode.org/orgcard.txt][this one for org-mode]] or this [[http://sachachua.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/How-to-Learn-Emacs-v2-Large.png][graphical one]]).
***** Org-mode                                                  :OrgMode:
  Many emacs shortcuts start by =C-x=. Org-mode's shortcuts generaly
  start with =C-c=.
  - =Tab= fold/unfold
  - =C-c c= capture (finish capturing with =C-c C-c=, this is explained on
    the top of the buffer that just opened)
  - =C-c C-c= do something useful here (tag, execute, ...)
  - =C-c C-o= open link
  - =C-c C-t= switch todo
  - =C-c C-e= export
  - =M-Enter= new item/section
  - =C-c a= agenda (try the =L= option)
  - =C-c C-a= attach files
  - =C-c C-d= set a deadl1ine (use =S-arrows= to navigate in the dates)
  - =A-arrows= move subtree (add shift for the whole subtree)
***** Org-mode Babel (for literate programming)                 :OrgMode:
  - =<s + tab= template for source bloc. You can easily adapt it to get
    this:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      #+begin_src shell
      ls
      #+end_src
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    Now if you =C-c C-c=, it will execute the block.
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  #+RESULTS:
  | #journal.org# |
  | journal.html  |
  | journal.org   |
  | journal.org~  |
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  - Source blocks have many options (formatting, arguments, names,
    sessions,...), which is why I have my own shortcuts =<b + tab= bash
    block (or =B= for sessions).
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
  #+begin_src shell :results output :exports both
  ls /tmp/*201*.pdf
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : /tmp/2015_02_bordeaux_otl_tutorial.pdf
  : /tmp/2015-ASPLOS.pdf
  : /tmp/2015-Europar-Threadmap.pdf
  : /tmp/europar2016-1.pdf
  : /tmp/europar2016.pdf
  : /tmp/M2-PDES-planning-examens-janvier2016.pdf
    #+END_EXAMPLE
  - I have defined many such templates in my configuration. You can
    give a try to =<r=, =<R=, =<RR=, =<g=, =<p=, =<P=, =<m= ...
  - Some of these templates are not specific to babel: e.g., =<h=, =<l=,
    =<L=, =<c=, =<e=, ...
***** In case you want to play with ipython/jupyter on a recent debian :Python:
Here is what you should install:
#+begin_src shell :results output :exports both
sudo apt-get install jupyter-notebook python3-matplotlib python3-numpy
#+end_src

On my machine, I got the version 5.2.2:
#+begin_src shell :results output :exports both
jupyter-notebook --version
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5.2.2

The ipython notebook can then be run with the following command:
#+begin_src shell :results output :exports both
jupyter-notebook
#+end_src

If you also want to use R in jupyter, follow [[https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel#installation][these instructions]].
***** In case you want to play with R/knitR/rstudio:                  :R:
Here is what you should install on debian:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo apt-get install r-base r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-knitr
#+END_SRC
Alternatively, if the installation of =r-cran-gplot2= or =r-cran-knitr=
fails, you may want to install them locally and manually by running
the following commands in R (or Rstudio):
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("ggplot2")
#+END_SRC

Rstudio is unfortunately not packaged within debian so the easiest is
to download the corresponding debian package on the [[http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop][Rstudio webpage]]
and then to install it manually (depending on when you do this, you
can obviously change the version number). Here is how to install it on
an old (stable) debian or ubuntu:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd /tmp/
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.1.423-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-1.1.423-amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -f install # to fix possibly missing dependencies
#+END_SRC
If you're running a more recent (testing or unstable) debian, you'll
probably want to use another debian package:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd /tmp/
wget https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-xenial-1.1.423-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i rstudio-xenial-1.1.423-amd64.deb
#+END_SRC
