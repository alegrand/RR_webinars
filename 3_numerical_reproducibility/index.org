* Practical information
Nathalie Revol, Philippe Langlois and Stef Graillat will present the
main challenges encountered when trying to achieve numerical
reproducibility and will present recent research work on this topic.
- Nathalie gave a general introduction and explained the kind of
  difficulties that could be encountered even in simple sequential codes.
- Stef presented several numerical techniques that can be used to
  control the accuracy of the computation. He also explained how they
  can be applied to numerical kernels.
- Philippe explained how they managed to apply some of these
  techniques to a real HPC parallel code with little performance loss.
