* Practical Information

The first step towards reproducibility of experiments based on
software is to be able to actually find the software that was used in
the experiment. While this seems to be self evident, in practice it
turns out to be not easy at all, and the tools which are commonly used
today have severe limitations.

In this talk, Roberto Di Cosmo will provide an overview of the issues
we face when trying to ensure that digital content in general, and
software in particular, is properly available and traceable.  In order
to address these issues, the [[https://www.softwareheritage.org/][Software Heritage]] initiative was started
at Inria, and we will report here on its progress.
