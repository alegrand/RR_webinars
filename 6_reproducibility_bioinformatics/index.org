* Practical Information
This talk will be given by [[https://www.lri.fr/~cohen/][Sarah Cohen Boulakia]], [[http://yvanlebras.fr/][Yvan Le Bras]] and
Jérôme Chopard.

Typical analysis processes in bioinformatics and computational biology
are complex, multi-staged, and large and may involve massive and
highly heterogeneous data sets. Ensuring reproducible bioinformatics
analyses is both increasingly important and highly difficult to
achieve.

In this webinar, our aim is three-folds.
1. After a quick presentation of the current status of reproducibility
   in bioinformatics and computational biology, we'll provide a global
   picture of the approaches and types of solutions currently in use
   in the bioinformatics community.
2. We will then consider two real use cases of biological data
   analyses, demonstrated on two very popular scientific workflow
   systems, namely, Galaxy and OpenAlea. We'll see how complementary
   such systems may be and how they help end-users deal with several
   levels of reproducibility (from redoing the exact same analysis, to
   replicate it in similar contexts, to reproduce the same results
   considering alternative methodologies).
3. We will wrap up the webinar by highlighting needs and draw research
   opportunities for the computer science and bioinformatics
   communities.
