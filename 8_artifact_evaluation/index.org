* Practical Information
This talk will be given by [[http://fursin.net/research.html][Grigori Fursin]].

In computer science (but also in computational science), research
claims are often based on digital artifacts (computer programs along
with their environment, data sets and meta information). Allowing
reviewers to evaluate such artifacts and others researchers to inspect
and possibly reuse such artifacts is essential to improve both the
faith in research claims and the capability to build on previous work.

In this talk, Grigori Fursin will present his experience with Artifact
Evaluation at computer systems' conferences. He will expose
encountered problems, solutions, future initiatives and supporting
frameworks.
