#+AUTHOR:    Arnaud Legrand
#+DATE: 2017
#+STARTUP: overview indent

This website gather documents and information related to the series of
webinars on reproducible research organized with several colleagues
with the support of ANR, CNRS, Inria, University of Grenoble, ...

*This website is under construction, so please check it regularly, especially a few days before the webinar to install the software
required in the practical session.*

*Next event*: July 20th 2017 on [[file:11_popper/index.org][The Popper Convention: An Approach to
Practical Falsifiable Research]]. In the meantime, why don't you just
have a look at the previous editions?

* General information
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility][Reproducibility]] of experiments and analysis by others is one of the
pillars of modern science. Yet, the description of experimental
protocols, software, and analysis is often lacunar and rarely allows a
third party to reproduce a study.  Such inaccuracies has become more
and more problematic and are probably the cause of the [[http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111005/full/478026a.html][increasing
number of article withdrawal even in prestigious journals]] and the
realization by both the scientific community and the general public
that [[http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124][many research results and studies were actually flawed and wrong]].
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science][Open science]] is the umbrella term of the movement to make scientific
research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an
inquiring society.


The aim of each of these webinars is to introduce the audience to one
particular aspect of reproducible research and to illustrate how this
aspect can be addressed with state-of-the-art tools. These webinars
are open to anyone (PhD students, post-doc, engineers, researchers,
...) and are in English (probably with a strong French accent
;-). They will take place generally on the first *Tuesday
afternoon (1:30PM-4:30PM UTC+1) of each month.* They generally consist
of two parts:
- Part 1. A 1-hour talk followed by a short Q&A session.
- Part 2. Ideally, a hands-on session if the topic allows. 2-3
  shorter specialized talks otherwise.

These presentations are screencast by [[https://mi2s.imag.fr/][MI2S]] and interactions during the
presentations take place through an other channel (pad, hangout, ...).
The resulting videos are then edited within a few days for a better
exploitation by people that would not have been able to attend the
event.

This website is still under construction and needs your help. It is
written in org-mode and benefits from github's pretty printing
capability. If you're logged on github, you can edit all files (like
in a wiki) and send me the modifications via a pull request. Just try
it, it's easy. Any comment and suggestion is welcome.
